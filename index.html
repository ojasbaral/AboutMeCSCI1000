    <p>Hi, my name is Ojas Baral, and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am from Denver, Colorado. I enjoying playing and watching sports. I also enjoy playing video games with my friends. I do not know which field of Computer Science I want to pursue, but I think if I had to choose right now I would choose software development. I am currently trying to learn JavaScript.</p>
